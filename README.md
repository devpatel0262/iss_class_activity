## Errors that I found:
- Line 1: Missing a colon after def is_narc(n)
- Line 3 and 4: Replaced == with =
- Line 6: Replaced *** with **
- Line 10: Placed a comma between start and end. Also put a semicolon in the end
- Line 12: Missing semicolon at the end
- Line 13: Fixed the function name from is_narcissistic to is_narc as defined above. Also put a semicolon in the end
- Line 16: Fixed the function name from print_narc_numbers to print_narcis_numbers

## Suggestions:
- Take the range to generate narc numbers as input rather than hardcoding it
